# Linux Metadata builder

The scripts in this repo are aimed at composing data elements suitable for populating an RDBMS with the following metadata of Enterprise Linux (RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux, and Oracle Linux) and its upstream sources (Fedora):

- Software package names, versions, and architectures
- Bugzillas solved across major/minor versions
- CVEs addressed across major/minor versions
- All known major and minor versions with parseable package repository metadata (primary, updates, other)
