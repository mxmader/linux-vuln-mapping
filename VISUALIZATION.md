# Notes on visualization with respect to the schema

- We generally only care about the latest minor version of a particular distro's major version for:
 - Referencing package to package relationships / dependencies ("requires" and "provides")
 - Referencing package group to package relationships

- We go across major & minor versions for:
 - Gathering all CVEs of packages by name
